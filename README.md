*elljay* is an experimental livejournal iOS client written in Swift.

It is in VERY early stages of development. Do not use.


# Getting started

*elljay* uses Cocoapods, the standard Cocoa dependency manager.

## Install cocoapods
```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

## Install dependencies
```
pod install
```

Now open ``elljay.xcworkspace`` and hit run.
